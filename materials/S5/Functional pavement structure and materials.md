# Functional pavement structure and materials

<aside>
💡 Heat-related

</aside>

Cool asphalt pavement is developed to mitigate(缓解) the urban heat island effect and reduce the influence pf high temperature on deformation(损坏) and rutting(车辙) of the asphalt pavement.

There are three types of cool pavements, reflective pavements, evaporative(蒸发) pavements and heat storage pavements.

**Reflective Pavements:**

Reflective pavements, is a kind of high-albedo pavements, are designed to reflect solar radiation. It use materials with high solar reflectance values, so they are usually gray or white.

E**vaporative pavement:**

It can hold water for evaportation to carry heat away from pavements. It’s suitable for rainy and humid region where there is no water storage problem. Includes porous pavement, permeable pavement

H**eat storage pavement**

It use materials with high heat storage capacities into the pavement structure. These materials can absorb and store excess heat during the day and release it gradually at night when temperatures are lower.

💡 Noise-related

</aside>

It is designed to reduce the traffic noise. The normal method is using noise barriers or walls, but road pavement can also used to reduce the traffic noise. 

Noise is generated by the interaction between the tire and the road. It can be divided into structual-borne npise which comes from like tread impact, and airborne noise which comes from like air pumping.

**Sound-absorption type**

Sound-absorption type pavement is engineered to reduce noise levels by absorbing sound energy. It typically consists of porous materials, such as porous asphalt or porous concrete, that allow sound waves to penetrate the pavement's surface and then dissipate within the pavement structure.

**Vibration-reduction type**

This type of pavement often uses special materials, like rubberized asphalt concrete. The elasticity of rubber particles can effective reduce the ground-borne vibrations caused by passing vehicles.

It can reduce the sound wave transmitted through the pavement
