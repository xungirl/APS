# Principles of Structure Design

It is about how to design all knid of structures, like concrete structure, steel structure, wood structure. But we just learned concrete structure, Reinforced concrete and prestressed reinforced concrete structure

**Ultimate limit state**

State of the structure at maximum load capacity

**serviceability limit state** 

The state in which the structure has reached one of the limits of normal use

**conditional limit state**

The state in which a structure can continue to carry loads despite localised damage

---

**permanent action**

**variable action**

**accidental action**

---

**Concrete carbonization**

Atmospheric carbon dioxide reacts with calcium hydroxide in concrete

**Corrosion of Reinforcement**

when moisture, oxygen, and chloride ions penetrate the concrete, leading to the rusting of the steel. 

**Freeze-Thaw Cycles**

When water in the concrete freezes, it expands, exerting pressure on the concrete. During thawing, the ice contracts, leaving voids in the concrete.

💡 Reinforced concrete structure

</aside>

Concrete is a kind of artificial stone, it is strong in compression but weak in tension.

If an appropriate amount of steel reinforcement is placed in the tensile zone of the concrete to take the tensile force instead of the concrete, a reinforced concrete structure is formed. In this way, the compressive strength of the concrete and the tensile strength of the steel reinforcement can be fully utilised.

**Standard Value for Compressive Strength of Cubes 立方体抗压强度标准值：**

It’s the standard strength of concrete cubes, typically 150x150x150 mm in size and made in standard method, at the age of 28th day

C30: Fcu,k = 30 MPa

**Creeping 徐变：**

It is a time-dependent deformation under a sustained load.

**Shrinkage 收缩：**

It is the reduction in the volume of concrete as it loses moisture over time. 

**Yield strength for steel reinforcement 钢筋屈服强度：**

Yield strength is generally used as a standard value for the ultimate strength of steel reinforcement

💡 Prestressed reinforced concrete structure

</aside>

**Principle**

prestressed concrete incorporates pre-applied internal stresses. For example, the prestressing imparts a compressive force on the concrete, which counteracts the tensile stresses induced by external loads. This compression enhances the concrete's ability to carry heavy loads, making it suitable for long-span structures and high-rise buildings.

**Advantage**

reduces cracks in the concrete, the concrete will last longer cause less cracks

makes full use of high-strength materials, saves materials and reduces the weight

**Disadvantage**

expensive, and difficult to control the camber

**Pre-Tensioning**

Tension the reinforcement first, then pour the concrete, and then loosen the temporary anchorage after the concrete reaches the required strength.

relies on the cohesive force to transmit the prestressing force

**Post-Tensioning**

Concrete is poured first, and after the concrete reaches the required strength, the prestressing steel bars are tensioned and anchored.

relies on the anchorage to transmit the prestressing force

**Prestressing Losses:**

1. **Friction**: Friction between the steel bars and the surrounding concrete consumes part of the applied prestressing force
2. **Anchorage Settling**: the deformation and movement of the anchorage devices 
3. **Temperature Effects**: Changes in temperature can affect the prestressing force. 
4. **Elastic Shortening**: When a prestressing force is applied to steel bars, the concrete and steel both experience elastic deformation. As a result, a portion of the initially applied stress is consumed in overcoming this initial deformation
5. **Relaxation of Steel**: Over time, steel experiences a phenomenon called relaxation, where it loses some of its initial stress. 
6. **Creeping of Concrete**: Over time, concrete undergoes creep, which is a slow deformation under sustained load. This deformation leads to a gradual reduction in prestress over time.
7. **Shrinkage of Concrete**: Concrete also undergoes shrinkage as it cures and dries. Shrinkage causes a reduction in prestress, especially in pre-tensioned systems.
