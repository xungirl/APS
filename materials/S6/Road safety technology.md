# Road safety technology

The professor presented some road safety cases in class, and we need to design a road at the end of the course, just like the practice of road surveying & design

For example, in one of our classes, we watched a legal programme, it listed some highway of death.

Itâ€™s not just in name, itâ€™s in reality. There was one road where accidents happened almost every two days, and about150 people died in a few years. This is mainly because the road has a continuous long downhill slope of about 30 kilometres. And sadly, the lorries are generally overloaded, so there are often cases of brake failure. 

The main character of this programme is a lorry driver, he had an accident on this road but was not seriously injured, but he still died because of this road, do you know why? Because after he recovered, he keeps driving the lorry and had another accident at the same location on this road, and died immediately. 

The final solution was to close this road and build another one.

I find it is interesting that the traffic police think the road is poorly designed, but the designer of the road claims that it's fully compliant and there's nothing they can do about those overloaded drivers
