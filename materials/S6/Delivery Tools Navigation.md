# Delivery Tools Navigation

This is an elective course outside our training program, so it is not so important

It is mainly about different navigation systems, like celestial navigation, inertia navigation, radio navigation, satellite navigation 

The class is mainly focused on satellite navigation, the professor introduced different satellite navigation systems, like GPS from the US, Glonass from russia, and Galileo from Europe

**Introduce**

HeyÔºÅThe purpose of studying this course is to help students understand the features of satellite navigation, grasp the basic concepts and principles of satellite navigation systems, learn about the concepts and principles of combined navigation systems, and understand the applications of navigation systems in the fields of transportation and logistics.

**1.Basic Knowledge of Satellite Navigation Systems**

A satellite navigation system is a global system that helps figure out where you are on Earth. It does this by getting signals from multiple satellites. Using math and time data, it can pinpoint your location, whether you're using a smartphone or car navigation system.

**2.Composition of the GPS System**

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a specific type of satellite navigation system run by the United States. It has three main parts:

1. **Space Part**: This includes satellites orbiting the Earth. Usually, there are 24 active satellites and some extras in case one fails.
2. **Control Part**: This involves ground stations that keep track of the satellites, update their information, and make sure they stay in their proper orbits.
3. **User Part**: This includes all the devices that use GPS to find out where they are, like your phone or car navigation system.

**3.What is Differential GPS (DGPS)?**

Differential GPS, or DGPS, is a way to make GPS more accurate. Ground stations pick up GPS signals and figure out if there's an error. They then send a correcting signal to DGPS-enabled devices to give a more accurate location.

**4.Combined Navigation Systems**

A combined navigation system mixes different types of navigation and location technologies to give an even more accurate and reliable way of figuring out where you are. Even if one system fails or has issues, the combined system can still give accurate information.

**5.Problems and Limitations of GPS:**

- **Signal Blocking and Interference**: In cities with tall buildings or in mountainous areas, GPS signals can get blocked.
- **Accuracy Issues**: While usually pretty accurate, various factors can affect how precise GPS is, especially when you need extremely accurate location data.
