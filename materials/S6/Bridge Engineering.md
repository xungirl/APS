# Bridge Engineering

This subject is mainly focuses on the types of bridges, their mechanics characteristics and how to design them. the main types of bridges are beam bridges, arch bridges, truss bridge, suspension bridges, cable-stayed bridges, but we just learned the beam bridge and arch bridge.

When designing a bridge, the bridge should be made as safe, durable, economical, aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly, and using advanced technology.

A beam bridge is one of the simplest and most common types of bridges in civil engineering. It is a straightforward structure that consists of one or more horizontal beams (or girders) supported at their ends by piers or abutments. Beam bridges are designed to span relatively short to moderate distances and are ideal for crossing rivers, small streams, highways, and other obstacles.

Reinforced concrete beam bridges generally have a span of 20m and prestressed reinforced concrete beam bridges 50m

ðŸ’¡ Arch bridge

Under vertical load, the piers or abutments of arch bridges will bear horizontal thrust, which can significantly reduce the bending moment in the arch, so arch bridges have greater spanning capacity

ðŸ’¡ Truss bridge

</aside>

The girders and columns of a truss bridge are connected together, and the stress state is between beam bridges and arch bridges, so the building height is smaller.

The primary load-bearing elements are the main cables

can span very long distances

also can span very long distances
