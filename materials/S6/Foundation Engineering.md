# Foundation Engineering

Foundation is the layer of ground that bear the loads of a building or affected by a building

Foundation engineering is the design and construction of the foundation systems for buildings, bridges, roads. It includes the Foundation Bearing Capacity, Foundation Deformation and Foundation Stability Analysis

Shallow foundations are a type of foundation used in construction to support relatively light to moderate loads. Their depth-to-width ratio is often less than 1. 

**Types of Shallow Foundations:**

1. **Spread Footings:** Spread footings are the most common type of shallow foundation. They consist of a concrete block that extends horizontally under a column or wall. The load from the structure is distributed over a larger area of soil, reducing the pressure on the ground.

1. **Strip Footings:** Strip footings are elongated spread footings that run along the length of a wall or column line. They are often used for load-bearing walls or continuous foundations beneath exterior walls.

**Key Features and Considerations:**

1. **Depth:** The depth is determined based on factors such as soil bearing capacity, frost depth, and structural load requirements.
2. **Foundation Design:** it needs Checking calculation of the bearing capacity, the stability and deformation of foundation size. Punching and shearing calculations of foundation depth.
3. **Construction Materials:** reinforced concrete or masonry. depends on factors like the load-bearing capacity of the soil and the specific requirements of the structure.
4. **Differential Settlement:** 
    
    Minimizing differential settlement is crucial for ensuring the stability and integrity of a structure. Differential settlement occurs when one part of the foundation settles more than another
    
    1. Ensure that the soil beneath the entire foundation area is uniformly compacted
    2. Improve the rigidity of the foundation
    3. reduce the weight of constructions

ðŸ’¡ Pile foundation

1. It has a higher vertical load-bearing capacity
2. It has high lateral stiffness and is resistant to overturning.
3. It can cross the bad soil layer

**Friction Piles:**
Friction piles, their load-bearing capacity primarily from the frictional resistance between the surface of the pile and the surrounding soil or rock. 

**End-Bearing Piles:**
the load-bearing capacity of the underlying rock or a dense, hard layer of soil, rather than the frictional resistance with the surrounding soil.

**Prefabricated Piles:**
are manufactured off-site and then transported to the construction site. They are suitable for a wide range of soil conditions and can be installed relatively quickly.

**Grouted Piles:**
are created by drilling a hole into the ground and then filling it with grout like cement.

ðŸ’¡ Foundation treatment

is a set of engineering techniques and methods used to enhance the properties of soil or rock beneath a construction site to improve its load-bearing capacity, stability, and overall performance. 

**Common Foundation Treatment Techniques:**

1. **Compaction:** Compaction is increasing the density of the soil by applying pressure. The construction itself, other heavy materials like stones to pressurize the foundation. and the Vacuum Preloading Method
2. **Replacement method**:   by removing unsuitable soil and replacing it with suitable material to improve the foundation.
3. **Dynamic compaction:** is a method that uses high-frequency vibrations to densify loose or granular soils.
