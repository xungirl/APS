ðŸ’¡ Road traffic model

</aside>

**Car-following model**

In one lane, the cars on it

canâ€™t over-taking

the car in front constains the speed

if the front carâ€™s state changes, the car behind it will follow, but after a period of time

**Traffic-volume model**

You can use possion distribution to describe the traffic situation that

the traffic density is low

vehicles doesnâ€™t affact each other

the traffic is random
