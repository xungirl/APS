# Probability theory and mathematicis statistics

This class includes probability basics, some common probability distribution, their expectation and variance, the joint distribution, and some theorems like the law of large number

It can be used to evaluate the likelihood of accidents. There is no need to make sure every construction is 100 percent safe and can withstand all disasters, it will cost too much money. If the construction is 99% safe, itâ€™s fine.

as the sample size increase, the average of the sample approachs the average of population

ðŸ’¡ Central limit theorem

when you take a large size of samples from any distribution, the distribution of those samplesâ€™ averages approache a normal distribution
