# College physics

This is a basic course that almost all STEM students take, it includes classical mechanics, Electromagnetism , Optics

Civil engineering generally only uses classical mechanics.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Classical Mechanics:** Classical mechanics deals with the motion of objects, the forces acting on them, and how they respond to those forces. It includes kinematics, Newton's laws of motion, energy, momentum, and rotational motion.

</aside>

**Kinematics**

the position, velocity, and acceleration of objects

**Newton's Laws of Motion** 

**Energy**

The law of conservation of energy

**Momentum**

The law of conservation of momentum

**Rotational Motion**

the conservation of angular momentum

ðŸ’¡ **Electromagnetism:** the interactions between electric and magnetic fields, including topics such as electric charge, electric potential, electric circuits, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic waves.

**Electric Charge:** Electromagnetism begins with the concept of electric charge. Particles can carry positive or negative electric charges, which create electric fields around them. Like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract, following Coulomb's law, which quantifies the force between charged particles.

**Electric Fields:** Electric fields are regions of influence surrounding charged objects. They exert forces on other charged particles placed within them. Electric fields are described by electric field lines that depict the direction and strength of the force experienced by a positive test charge.

**Electric Potential and Voltage:** Electric potential, often referred to as voltage, measures the electric potential energy per unit charge at a specific point in space. It is crucial in understanding the flow of electric charge within circuits and electric devices. Voltage drives the motion of charges in electric circuits.

**Magnetic Fields:** Moving electric charges generate magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are represented by magnetic field lines, and their strength and direction are described by the magnetic field vector. The behavior of magnetic fields is governed by AmpÃ¨re's law and Biot-Savart law.

ðŸ’¡ **Waves and Vibrations:** This topic covers the behavior of mechanical and electromagnetic waves, as well as harmonic motion and wave properties.

</aside>

**Harmonic Motion:** is a repetitive and oscillatory type of motion commonly observed in nature. The motion is characterized by a sinusoidal pattern. Examples of harmonic motion include a swinging pendulum, or a mass-spring system.

**Mechanical Waves:** Mechanical waves propagate through a medium. Like water waves, which are transverse waves and sound waves which are longitudinal waves.

**Electromagnetic Waves:** from radio waves to visible light to X-rays

ðŸ’¡ **Optics:** Optics deals with the behavior of light, including reflection, refraction, lenses, and mirrors. It also covers wave properties of light and the electromagnetic spectrum.
