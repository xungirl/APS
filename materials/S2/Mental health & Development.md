# Mental health & Development

It is an elective course

We learnt some basics knowledge of mental health, such as how to deal with stress and anxiety, some of the signs of mental illness, like Depression and bipolar disorder. We played some games on classes, and took a online test about mental health knowledge as the final. 

In 2021 I was not in a very good mental health condition, which is why I did not do well in these two semesters, and I think that this class is useless.
