# Cognitive Practice

We took the course after the first year, during the summer school. The school took us to visit some construction sites, museums, and factories to give us a basic understanding of the civil engineering industry and show us what the future work environment might be like. I think their main goal was subtly encouraging us to change majors.

On the first day, we visited the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in the 1960s and is an arch bridge. We mainly toured the museum, but I didn't see much because I almost died that day because of carsick.

We also went to the Maoyisheng museum near the Runyang Bridge, where they had a slice of the main cable of the Runyang Bridge, about this big. they said it could wrap around the Earth three times if you connected all the steel ropes inside.

We also visited a company that produces steel structures. The company is located near the Yangtze River, so they can easily transport goods to the construction sites of bridges. Because they take on a lot of projects, they paint their products in different colors for easy identification.
