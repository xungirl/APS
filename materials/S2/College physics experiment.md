ðŸ’¡ Newton's Rings Experiment

</aside>

**Introduce:**

I did an experiment before, It is using Newton's rings to determine the radius of curvature of a convex lens 

**Principle**

interfere, interference

ðŸ’¡ Millikan Oil Drop Experiment

</aside>

**Introduce:**

This experiment measures the charge of an electron. 

**Principle**

We watch how oil drops move in an electric field to figure out how much charge is on them. 

The charge of an oil drop must be an integer multiple of the charge of an electron

We spray tiny drops of oil in a special box, and see how fast they go up or down when we turn on an electric field.

**Experimental Steps**

1. Get a box that can make an electric field.
2. Spray little oil drops into the box.
3. Turn on the electric field.
4. Look at how the oil drops move with a microscope.
5. Write down how fast and long the drops go up or down.
6. Use the numbers to find out the charge on the oil drops.

The result I came up with were very different from the standard values
