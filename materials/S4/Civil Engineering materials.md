💡 Aggregates: Aggregates, such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone, are essential components of concrete and asphalt mixtures. They provide structural support and act as filler

Grading is the classification and matching of the constituent particles in aggregates

1. **Purpose of Grading**:
    - **Strength and Durability**: Properly graded aggregates in concrete and asphalt can enhance the strength, durability.
    - **Drainage and Compaction**: In soils, grading influences drainage properties and compaction characteristics.

1. **Grading Categories**:
    - **Well-Graded**: A well-graded mixture contains a wide range of particle sizes. This distribution reduces voids between particles, improving the material's density and strength.
    - **Gap-Graded**: Gap-graded materials intentionally exclude certain particle sizes, creating gaps in the distribution. This can be used for specific purposes, like porous pavement, to enhance drainage or reduce noise.

- **Poorly Graded**: Poorly graded materials have an uneven distribution of particle sizes, which can result in poor workability, reduced strength, or inadequate drainage.

💡 **Asphalt**: Asphalt is a common material for road construction.

</aside>

1. **Composition**:
    - Asphalt is a material derived from oil.
    - Asphalt typically consists of two primary components: bitumen (the binder) and aggregates (usually sand, gravel, or crushed stone).
    - Bitumen is composed of Oil, Resins, and Asphaltenes.

1. **Types of Asphalt**:
    - **Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)**: This is the most common type of asphalt used in road construction. It is produced at high temperatures
    - **Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA)**: WMA is produced at lower temperatures than HMA, making it more environmentally friendly by reducing energy consumption and emissions during production.
    - **Cold Mix Asphalt**: Cold mix asphalt can be prepared and applied at ambient temperatures. It is often used for temporary repairs and in situations where hot asphalt isn't readily available.

💡 Lime and cement

**Lime**:

1. **Composition**:
    - Lime is calcined(煅烧) from limestone.

**Cement**:

1. **Composition**:
    - The most common type of cement is Portland cement, which is produced by heating limestone, clay, and other materials in a kiln.
2. **Uses**:
    - **Concrete**: Cement is a primary ingredient in concrete, where it binds aggregates (such as sand and gravel) to form a strong and durable composite material used in construction for buildings, bridges, roads, and more.
    - **Mortar**: Cement is a key component in mortar(砂浆)
3. **Advantages**:
    - Cement offers high compressive strength, making it ideal for load-bearing applications.
    - Cement is readily available and widely used worldwide.

💡 Cement concrete

</aside>

**Composition**:

Cement concrete is an artificial stone consist of cement, water and aggregates, and admixture

1. **Cement**: Cement is the binding agent that holds the mixture together. The most common type of cement used is Portland cement.
2. **Aggregates**
3. **Water**: Water is added to the dry mixture to activate the cement's chemical reactions and facilitate the mixing and placement of the concrete.

**Key Factors Affecting Workability**:

1. **Consistency(流动性)**: Concrete should be fluid enough to fill formwork and molds. The consistency of concrete is how easily the cement flows. 
2. **Plasticity(可塑性)**: There should be a certain degree of cohesion between the internal materials of cement concrete, so that external forces won’t make it break easily.
3. **Stability**: the stability of internal materials. 
4. **Ease of Mixing**: Easy to form a dense and stable structure that can be spread over the entire space of the mould.

You can use Slump test or Vebe Consistometer test to measure the workability

**Factors Influencing Workability**:

Several factors affect concrete workability, including:

- **Water-Cement Ratio:** Higher water-cement ratios typically result in more workable but weaker concrete.
- **Aggregate Grading**
- **Admixtures**
- **Mixing Time**

**Standard Value for Compressive Strength of Cubes 立方体抗压强度标准值：**

It’s the standard strength of concrete cubes, typically 150x150x150 mm in size and made in standard method, at the age of 28th day

C30: Fcu,k = 30 MPa

**Key Features**:

- **Strength**: Concrete has high compressive strength, but low tensile strength,
- **Durability**: Well-constructed concrete structures have a long service life and can withstand environmental factors
- **Fire Resistance**: Concrete is inherently fire-resistant, making it a preferred choice for building structures where fire safety is essential.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Cheap

**Applications**:

- **Buildings**
- **Bridges and Roads**: Concrete is commonly used in the construction of bridges and road surfaces due to its load-bearing capacity and durability.
