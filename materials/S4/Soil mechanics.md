# Soil mechanics

Soil mechanics is the study of the behavior of soils and their interactions with structures and foundations. It plays a crucial role in civil engineering, providing the foundation for the design and construction of various infrastructure projects, including buildings, bridges, dams, roads, and tunnels.

ðŸ’¡ Soil Properties

</aside>

Soils includes three main phases: the solid phase, the liquid phase, and the gas phase. 

1. **Solid Phase:** The solid phase consists of mineral particles, organic matter, and other solid materials.  The solid phase provides the structural framework of the soil. Soil particle size is the most important factor affecting soil properties
2. **Liquid Phase:** The liquid phase of soils refers to the water that occupies the void spaces between the solid particles. 
3. **Gas Phase:** The gas phase in soils refers to the air in the void spaces between the solid particles.

ðŸ’¡ Soil Classification: Soils are classified into different types based on their particle sizes and characteristics. such as gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Each type of soil has distinct engineering properties and behavior.

ðŸ’¡ Infiltration properties of soils. This refers to the ability of the soil to be penetrated by a liquid.

ðŸ’¡ The stresses in the soil are classified into self-gravity stresses and additional stresses

</aside>

the self-gravity stresses coming from the self-weight of the soil and the additional stresses coming from the external loads. 

A rise in the water table will result in an increase in the effective self-gravitational stresses in the soil, which may cause settlement

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Settlement Analysis: Settlement analysis assesses how much a structure or foundation will sink or settle over time due to the compressibility of the underlying soil.

</aside>

1. **Causes of Settlement:**
    - Settlement occurs primarily due to the consolidation of soil. When a structure is subjected to external forces, it will cause the soil particles to rearrange and expel the water and gas in it. This process leads to soil compaction and settlement.
2. **Types of Settlement:**
- **Immediate Settlement:** This occurs immediately after the structure is constructed or loaded and is primarily associated with the compression of the soil.
- **Consolidation Settlement:** This is a slower and ongoing settlement process that happens as excess pore water is gradually expelled from the soil over time. Consolidation settlement can continue for an extended period, sometimes years after construction.

ðŸ’¡ Retaining Structures:  to prevent landslides

**Types of Retaining Walls:**

1. **Gravity Retaining Walls:** These walls rely on their weight to resist soil pressure. They are typically made from concrete, stone, or other heavy materials 
2. **Cantilever Retaining Walls:** Cantilever walls utilize the leverage principle to resist soil pressure. Steel
3. **Counterfort Retaining Walls:** Counterfort walls are similar to cantilever walls but have additional vertical support. These counterforts enhance the wall's stability.
4. **Anchored Retaining Walls:** Anchored walls have embedded rods or cables that extend into the soil behind the wall. These anchors provide additional horizontal support 

**The Rankine Theory**

focuses primarily on frictional resistance between the walls and the soil, is often used for non-cohesive soils

**the Coulomb Theory** 

both friction and cohesion, is applied when cohesive properties are significant or when a more general approach is needed.
