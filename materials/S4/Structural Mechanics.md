# Structural Mechanics

Structural mechanics focuses on the study of structures made up of rods, It mainly includes two parts: Statically determinate structures and statically indeterminate structures

**1. Statically Determinate Structure:**

A statically determinate structure is one in which the equilibrium equations (i.e., the equations governing the balance of forces and moments) alone are sufficient to solve for all internal forces and deformations within the structure. 

**2. Statically Indeterminate Structure:**

A statically indeterminate structure is one in which the equilibrium equations alone are insufficient to determine all internal forces and deformations. This means that you need additional information

üí° Force and Displacement Methods for Displacement

</aside>

The force method adds a virtual force to the structure and the displacement method assumes that the structure has a virtual displacement

**Force method**

The force method uses the redundant unknown force as the basic unknown quantity

**Displacement method**

The displacement method uses the displacement as the basic unknown quantity.

**Moment distribution method:**

The moment distribution method is a variant of the displacement method, which avoids solving the typical equations and instead calculates the rod end moments by a step-by-step approach 

**Displacement method in matrix**

is another variant of the displacement method, it breaks down the structure into smaller units and then operates on them in the form of matrices, which are more suitable for computer operations

üí° Influence line

</aside>

An influence line to visualize the effect of a moving load (such as a vehicle or a force) on a structure

**Static method:**

List the equilibrium equations, solve the function of the shear force or bending moment to the position, and then make a graph of the influence line

**Kinematical method:**

it uses virtual displacement principle.

The influence line of the force at a point is proportional to the virtual displacement.
