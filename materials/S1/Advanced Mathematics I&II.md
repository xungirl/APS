# Advanced Mathematics I&II

It is a fundamental class that most students will take. It mainly includes differential calculus and integral calculus.

**Derivatives:** 

Differential calculus focuses on how quantities change with respect to one another. 

The central concept is the derivative. A derivative measures the rate of change of a function at a specific point. 

Derivatives can find the slope of a tangent line at a particular point, and find the maximum and minimum values of functions.

There are also some common theorems that can simplify calculations

**L’Hopital’s rule:**

💡 **Integral Calculus**

</aside>

It's essentially the reverse process of differential calculus.

For us, it is uaually used to calculate areas, work done by a force, and finding the center of mass of an object.

💡 Multivariable function

</aside>

Some fuctions have more than one variable

If you want to differentiate the multivariable function, you can use the concept of partial differentiation, you hold one variable constant and then differentiate the other variable
