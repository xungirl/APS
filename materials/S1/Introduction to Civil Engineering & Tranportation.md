# Introduction to Civil Engineering & Tranportation

In the first year, civil engineering and transport students take the same basic courses together, and after the first year we need to choose the schools and directions we prefer, so this course is a brief introduction to these different directions

**Traffic Engineering**

Traffic engineering focuses on the design and management of transportation systems

They also learn fundamental of traffic engineering, road surveying and design. But their classes are mainly about smth like traffic control, traffic data analysis, and a lot of programming.

**Transportation Engineering**

It focus on creating safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation networks. 

road, railway, water and air transportation

Their classes are like Transport system information and control, Transport economics

**Surveying and mapping engineering**

Surveying and mapping engineering focuses on the precise measurement, mapping, and analysis of the Earth's surface and its features.

They also learn programming classes like data structures 

**Port and waterway Engineering**

It focuses on harbour construction, cargo handling in harbours, construction of locks, shipping capacity and safety of waterways.

Hydraulics, waterway engineering, harbor engineering

**Highway and Bridge Engineering**

The design and construction of road and bridge.

**Urban underground space engineering**

focuses on the planning, design, construction, and management of infrastructure, facilities, and spaces located beneath the surface of cities and urban areas. 

Their classes are the most similar to ours, a lot of structural mechanics. underground dynamics

**Civil Engineering**

the design, construction and maintance of buildings

**Engineering management**

the management of projects and organizations

They don't have to study mechanics, they study economics, law

**Engineering mechanics**

All kinds of mechanics

**Water supply and drainage**

They study water supply and drainage in houses and need to study materials and chemistry

**Intelligent construction**

combination of computer science and civil engineering

It use advanced technology to enhance the efficiency and safety of projects.
