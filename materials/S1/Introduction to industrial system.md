# Introduction to industrial system

This is also a basic course that most students will take.

first, we learned the history of industrial system, how did ancient people use tools, how did the three industrial revolutions happen.

Then we went to the industrial training base inside the school, itâ€™s mainly about how to forge by hand and machine, I remember there were some machine tools, the staff demonstrated how to use them, but we were not allowed to get close. We also saw how the 3D printing equipment was used, which was cool.
